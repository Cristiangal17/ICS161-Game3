For this game, since it is a 2-player game, we created a racing game. They are two players that are competing in a maze and they can grab power ups. We wanted users to feel like they were genuinely competing. For this we used different techniques to try to invoke this feeling.


For this assignment, we downloaded a couple of assets. 

The First was the character model that we named Ethan. We used the Unity character import package. For the music, we used the song called sound cloud by Wes smith
